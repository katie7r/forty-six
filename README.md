# Forty-Six

These are my dotfiles. This is where they live.

# To Use

    $ cd $HOME
    $ git clone git@github.com:katie7r/forty-six.git
    $ forty-six/nix/bootstrap.sh

# Gotchas

When using a non-default email address (e.g., work account uses work email), commit changes prior to running the bootstrap script to avoid committing `gitconfig` with the altered email address.
